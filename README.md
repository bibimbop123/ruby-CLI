Lore:

"In ages past, our world stood divided among four mighty nations, each wielding the raw power of a distinct element. Water, Earth, Fire, and Air were not mere forces; they were the pulsating essence that upheld the delicate equilibrium of existence. Born from the very fabric of these elements were creatures, each bearing an innate affinity. Yet, in the face of impending chaos, emerged a singular saviorâ€”the Code-bro, whose element of friendship held the key to salvation, destined to reshape the fate of our world."
